This works in two\n    ways:\n\n    1. The list of activation vectors is stored in a multiprocessing manager, which allows multiple\n        processes (typically multiple GPUs) to read/write to the list.\n    2. The `extend` method is non-blocking, and uses a threadpool to write to the list in the\n        background, which allows the main process to continue working even if there is just one GPU.\n\n    Extends the `torch.utils.data.Dataset` class to provide a list-based activation store, with\n    additional :meth:`append` and :meth:`extend` methods (the latter of which is non-blocking).\n\n    Note that the built-in :meth:`shuffle` method is much faster than using the `shuffle` argument\n    on `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`. You should therefore call this method before passing the\n    dataset to the loader and then set the DataLoader `shuffle` argument to `False`.\n\n    Examples:\n    Create an empty activation dataset:\n\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; import torch\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; store = ListActivationStore()\n\n    Add a single activation vector to the dataset (this is blocking):\n\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; store.append(torch.randn(100))\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; len(store)\n        1\n\n    Add a batch of activation vectors to the dataset (non-blocking):\n\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; batch = torch.randn(10, 100)\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; store.extend(batch)\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; len(store)\n        11\n\n    Shuffle the dataset **before passing it to the DataLoader**:\n\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; store.shuffle() # Faster than using the DataLoader shuffle argument\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(store, shuffle=False, batch_size=2)\n\n    Use the dataloader to iterate over the dataset:\n\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; next_item = next(iter(loader))\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; next_item.shape\n        torch.Size([2, 100])\n    \"\"\"\n\n    _data: list[InputOutputActivationVector] | ListProxy\n    \"\"\"Underlying List Data Store.\"\"\"\n\n    _device: torch.device | None\n    \"\"\"Device to Store the Activation Vectors On.\"\"\"\n\n    _pool: ProcessPoolExecutor | None = None\n    \"\"\"Multiprocessing Pool.\"\"\"\n\n    _pool_exceptions: ListProxy | list[Exception]\n    \"\"\"Pool Exceptions.\n\n    Used to keep track of exceptions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    _pool_futures: list[Future]\n    \"\"\"Pool Futures.\n\n    Used to keep track of processes running in the pool.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        data: list[InputOutputActivationVector] | None = None,\n        device: torch.device | None = None,\n        max_workers: int | None = None,\n        *,\n        multiprocessing_enabled: bool = False,\n    ) -&gt; None:\n        \"\"\"Initialize the List Activation Store.\n\n        Args:\n            data: Data to initialize the dataset with.\n            device: Device to store the activation vectors on.\n            max_workers: Max CPU workers if multiprocessing is enabled, for writing to the list.\n                Default is the number of cores you have.\n            multiprocessing_enabled: Support reading/writing to the dataset with multiple GPU\n                workers.
