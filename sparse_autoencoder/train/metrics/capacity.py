    """Calculate capacities.

    Measure the capacity of a set of features as defined in [Polysemanticity and Capacity in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01892.pdf).

    Capacity is intuitively measuring the 'proportion of a dimension' assigned to a feature.
    Formally it's the ratio of the squared dot product of a feature with itself to the sum of its
    squared dot products of all features.

    If the features are orthogonal, the capacity is 1. If they are all the same, the capacity is
    1/n.

    Example:
        >>> import torch
        >>> orthogonal_features = torch.tensor([[1., 0., 0.], [0., 1., 0.], [0., 0., 1.]])
        >>> orthogonal_caps = calc_capacities(orthogonal_features)
        >>> orthogonal_caps

    Args:
        features: A collection of features.

    Returns:
        A 1D tensor of capacities, where each element is the capacity of the corresponding feature.
