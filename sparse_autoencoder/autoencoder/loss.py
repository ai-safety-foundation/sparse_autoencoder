    """Reconstruction Loss (MSE).

    MSE reconstruction loss is calculated as the mean squared error between each each input vector
    and it's corresponding decoded vector. The original paper found that models trained with some
    loss functions such as cross-entropy loss generally prefer to represent features
    polysemantically, whereas models trained with MSE may achieve the same loss for both
    polysemantic and monosemantic representations of true features.

    Examples:
    >>> input_activations = torch.tensor([[3.0, 4]])
    >>> output_activations = torch.tensor([[1.0, 5]])
    >>> reconstruction_loss(input_activations, output_activations)

        input_activations: Input activations.
        output_activations: Reconstructed activations.
