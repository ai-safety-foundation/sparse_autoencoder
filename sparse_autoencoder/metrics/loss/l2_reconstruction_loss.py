class L2ReconstructionLoss(Metric):
    """L2 Reconstruction loss (MSE).

    L2 reconstruction loss is calculated as the sum squared error between each each input vector
    and it's corresponding decoded vector. The original paper found that models trained with some
    loss functions such as cross-entropy loss generally prefer to represent features
    polysemantically, whereas models trained with L2 may achieve the same loss for both
    polysemantic and monosemantic representations of true features. 
    
    You have the option to set L2 reconstruction loss to normalize the input activations before
    calculating the loss. This can be useful because the input vectors can vary in magnitude and
    normalizing them can help to ensure that the loss is not dominated by the magnitude of the
    activations.
    
    Example:
        >>> import torch
        >>> loss = L2ReconstructionLoss(num_components=1)
        >>> source_activations = torch.tensor([
        ...     [ # Batch 1
        ...         [4., 2.] # Component 1
        ...     ],
        ...     [ # Batch 2
        ...         [2., 0.] # Component 1
        ...     ]
        ... ])
        >>> decoded_activations = torch.tensor([
        ...     [ # Batch 1
        ...         [2., 0.] # Component 1 (MSE of 4)
        ...     ],
        ...     [ # Batch 2
        ...         [0., 0.] # Component 1 (MSE of 2)
        ...     ]
        ... ])
        >>> loss.forward(
        ...     decoded_activations=decoded_activations, source_activations=source_activations
        ... )
