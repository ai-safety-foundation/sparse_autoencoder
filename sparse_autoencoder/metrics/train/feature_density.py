    """Feature density metric.

    Percentage of samples in which each feature was active (i.e. the neuron has "fired"), in a
    training batch.

    Generally we want a small number of features to be active in each batch, so average feature
    density should be low. By contrast if the average feature density is high, it means that the
    features are not sparse enough.

    Example:
        >>> metric = FeatureDensityMetric(num_learned_features=3, num_components=1)
        >>> learned_activations = torch.tensor([
        ...     [ # Batch 1
