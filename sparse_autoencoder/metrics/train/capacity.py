    """Capacities Metrics for Learned Features.

    Measure the capacity of a set of features as defined in [Polysemanticity and Capacity in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01892.pdf).

    Capacity is intuitively measuring the 'proportion of a dimension' assigned to a feature.
    Formally it's the ratio of the squared dot product of a feature with itself to the sum of its
    squared dot products of all features.

    If the features are orthogonal, the capacity is 1. If they are all the same, the capacity is
    1/n.
