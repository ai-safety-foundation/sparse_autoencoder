    """Capacities metric.

    Measure the capacity of a set of features as defined in [Polysemanticity and Capacity in Neural
    Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01892.pdf).

    Capacity is intuitively measuring the 'proportion of a dimension' assigned to a feature.
    Formally it's the ratio of the squared dot product of a feature with itself to the sum of its
    squared dot products of all features.

    Warning:
        This is memory intensive as it requires caching all learned activations for a batch.

    Examples:
        If the features are orthogonal, the capacity is 1.

        >>> metric = CapacityMetric()
        >>> learned_activations = torch.tensor([
        ...     [ # Batch 1
        ...         [1., 0., 1.] # Component 1: learned features
        ...     ],
        ...     [ # Batch 2
        ...         [0., 1., 0.] # Component 1: learned features (orthogonal)
        ...     ]
        ... ])
        >>> metric.forward(learned_activations)
        tensor([[1., 1.]])

        If they are all the same, the capacity is 1/n.

        >>> learned_activations = torch.tensor([
        ...     [ # Batch 1
        ...         [1., 1., 1.] # Component 1: learned features
        ...     ],
        ...     [ # Batch 2
        ...         [1., 1., 1.] # Component 1: learned features (same)
